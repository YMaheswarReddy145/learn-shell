The Problem of Shell Scripting
   1. At scale shell is pain
       That means when we are doing the things with much much bigger scripts and running them on the different operating
        systems like many many machines, it is a bit difficult to manage.

   2. Shell is imperative
       That means we have to tell everything do these and do that i..e, in expense project we re asking to check the user
         if user is present don't add and if it's not add the user. similar to the directory too.

   3. Shell script is Homogenous
       That means it can only work with single operating system, it means like you know you're writing the script probably
         and you re running these particular script. But if you take the sme  script and try to execute in some other
         operating systems like ubuntu its fails.

 AS of now what we are doing is writing the shell script and logging in to that machine and cloning the git repository
    and executing the script.
   where s if we have many machines out there then how we deal with that is the major problem.

 To solve the above problems configuration management tool will help

 Configuration Management Tools
  --> It help us in making the  OS level features with much more advanced way (like declarative way)
      Tools that helps in making OS level changes with much more advanced features are tools consider under the
       configuration management tools.
          1. CFE Engine
          2. Puppet
          3. Chef
          4. Ansible

In today market it all about Ansible.

How Ansible solve shell problems.
    1. Ansible is declarative.
    2. Ansible support heterogeneous by default
    3. Ansible can scale to large infrastructure.
