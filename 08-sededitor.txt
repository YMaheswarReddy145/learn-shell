Suppose we got an requirement asking to edit a file and update the configuration or something then we use sed editor

Some of the operations we can do with  file is
   1. Search & Replace Word
   2. Delete the lines
   3. Add your lines
   4. Replace the lines

Note: -i is used to updated in the file, if we don't give -i then the file is not update wht ever the changes you made
       they just updated in the output only.

These are the operations that we generally prefer to get in the command line editor so which we can edit the file directly
  rather than opening in VI and go into insert mode and saving the file. we use the SED editor


Assume we have a file with a data like this
    root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
    bin:x:1:1:bin:/bin:/sbin/nologin
    daemon:x:2:2:daemon:/sbin:/sbin/nologin
    adm:x:3:4:adm:/var/adm:/sbin/nologin

 1. Search & Replace Word
    To search and replace anything we use the below command
    syntax : sed 's/search/replace/' <filename>

    sed 's/nologin/yeslogin/' file
     Here S --- substitute
          / --- Boundary
          In place of nologin we are replacing with yeslogin
          file --- it is a filename

   However after executing the above command if you check in the file(cat filename) then we can see the changes are not
    modified because sed is only generating the output in the output only its not modifying the file.

   Now to modify the changes in the file not only in the output we use -i
       sed -i 's/nologin/yeslogin/' file

   Assume we have a file with a data like this and you want to replace root with admin
        root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
        bin:x:1:1:bin:/bin:/sbin/nologin
        daemon:x:2:2:daemon:/sbin:/sbin/nologin
        adm:x:3:4:adm:/var/adm:/sbin/nologin

       sed 's/root/admin/' file
   But the issue with the above command is if you have a root more then 1time in the first line, the sed will update only
    the first root in the line and then it will go to the next line immediately, without searching and replacing the
    rest of the root occurrences in 1st line. this is the behaviour of the SED editor.
   So to stop this behaviour and replace all the occurrences of root with admin then simply we can go with global

        sed 's/root/admin/g' file
     Here g ---- stand for Global
   Now with the help of the above command all the occurrences of root is updated to admin

2. Delete The Lines
    we can delete the lines in two ways
    1. With line number
        sed '2d' file
     Here 2d ----> Delete the 2nd line
        file ----> Name of the file

    2. By searching the word and delete the lines
         sed '/yeslogin/ d' file
        Here we are deleting the lines which contain the yeslogin word.


3. Adding  The Lines
    we can add the lines in two ways
    1. With line number
        sed '2a Maheswar Reddy' file
     Here 2a ----> Add the line after the 2nd line
        file ----> Name of the file

    2. By searching the word and adding the lines
         sed '/yeslogin/ a Maheswar Reddy' file
        Here we are adding the line after the yeslogin word.


4. Replace or Change The Lines
    we can replace the lines in two ways
    1. With line number
        sed '2c Maheswar Reddy' file
     Here 2c ----> Replace the line 2 with Maheswar Reddy
        file ----> Name of the file

    2. By searching the word and replacing the lines
         sed '/yeslogin/ c Maheswar Reddy' file
        Here we are replacing the line with maheswr reddy which contain the yeslogin word.

Suppose if you want to perform multiple  operation with a single sed command we use -e
   sed -e '1d' -e '2a Maheswar Reddy' file

  Now it will delete the 1st line and add a new line after the 2nd line
